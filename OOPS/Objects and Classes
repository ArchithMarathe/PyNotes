What is an Object?
  An object can be thought of as a Container, that has state(attributes/data) and behaviour(methods/functionality).

How to Create an Object?
  Classes are blueprints/templates that are used to create the objects.
  Classes are also called as types.
  Objects created of a type/class are called instances of that type/class.

What are Classes?
  Classes are themselves objects in python,they have:
    1. Attributes - Eg : __name__
    2. Behaviour - Eg : __init__
  Classes are created from the 'type' metaclass.
  Classes are callable ,Eg: MyClass() and return instance an instance of the class.
  The type of the returned instance is MyClass.
  Eg : my_obj = MyClass()
       type(my_obj) -> MyClass -> (object,classes are objects)
       isinstance(my_obj, MyClass) -> True
